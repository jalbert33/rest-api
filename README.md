This is an example REST API application based on [Symlex Core](https://github.com/symlex/symlex-core).

## Setup ##

Before you start, make sure you have PHP 7.1+, [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your system 
([howto](https://docs.symlex.org/en/latest/osx/) for Mac OS X).
Instead of using Docker, you can also setup your own runtime environment based on the existing 
[Dockerfiles](https://github.com/symlex/rest-api/tree/master/app/docker) (not recommended).

**Step 1:** Run `composer` to create a new project:

```
composer create-project symlex/rest-api myapp
```

**Step 2:** Start nginx and PHP using `docker-compose`:

```
cd myapp
docker-compose up
```

**Step 3:** Open http://localhost:8088/example/123 in a browser ([source](src/Controller/ExampleController.php)).

Our complete framework documentation can be found on [docs.symlex.org](https://docs.symlex.org/en/latest/).

## About ##

Symlex is maintained by [Michael Mayer](https://blog.liquidbytes.net/about/) and
aims to simplify agile Web development by providing a working system that promotes best practices by example.
Michael released his [first PHP framework](http://freshmeat.sourceforge.net/projects/awf) in 2001 and 
has worked with various major framework vendors in the past.
Building this would not have been possible without a lot of prior work by other developers.
Thank you to those and everyone who contributed!
